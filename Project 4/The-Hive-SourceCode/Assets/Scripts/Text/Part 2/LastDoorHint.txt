Peter,
The monster...I have no idea how it got in here.
I cannot stop it, but the traps, they can damage it.
The key to the office is in my pocket. I hope the monster will not take it after I die.
If you find my note, please tell Doris and Mary I love them.
I trully enjoy the time working with you.
Josh forever your friend
